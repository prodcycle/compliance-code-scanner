# ProdCycle Compliance Code Scanner

A GitHub Action that scans pull request changes for compliance violations against SOC 2, HIPAA, and NIST frameworks via the [ProdCycle](https://prodcycle.com) API.

> **Requires a ProdCycle account.** This action calls the ProdCycle compliance API, which requires a valid API key (`pc_...`). [Sign up at prodcycle.com](https://app.prodcycle.com) to get started.

## How it works

The action supports two modes (managed automatically by default):

**1. Pull Request mode (diff scan)**
When run on a `pull_request` event:
- Collects the **diffs** of changed files from the PR (only the changed lines are analyzed)
- Sends them to the ProdCycle compliance check API
- Creates inline annotations on the PR for each finding
- Posts a summary comment with severity and framework breakdown
- Fails the check if findings match the configured severity threshold

**2. Push / Merge mode (full scan)**
When run on a `push` event (e.g., merge to `main`):
- Collects and scans the **entire codebase**
- Validates all tracked files against compliance frameworks
- Reports any findings in the GitHub Actions summary

## Quick start

Add the following workflow to automatically scan both pull requests and merges to your default branch:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/compliance.yml
name: Compliance Code Scanner
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master

jobs:
  compliance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: prodcycle/compliance-code-scanner@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.PRODCYCLE_API_KEY }}
```

## Prerequisites

- A **ProdCycle account** ([sign up at prodcycle.com](https://prodcycle.com))
- A **ProdCycle API key** generated from your workspace settings
- Compliance check enabled on your workspace

## Setup

### 1. Generate an API key

In ProdCycle, go to **Settings > API** and create a compliance check API key. The key starts with `pc_`.

### 2. Add the key to GitHub secrets

In your repository, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add a new secret:

- **Name:** `PRODCYCLE_API_KEY`
- **Value:** Your `pc_...` key

### 3. Add the workflow

Create `.github/workflows/compliance.yml` in your repository with the configuration above.

## Examples

### Scan specific frameworks

```yaml
- uses: prodcycle/compliance-code-scanner@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.PRODCYCLE_API_KEY }}
    frameworks: soc2,hipaa,nist
```

### Only fail on critical findings

```yaml
- uses: prodcycle/compliance-code-scanner@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.PRODCYCLE_API_KEY }}
    fail-on: critical
```

### Scan only infrastructure files

```yaml
- uses: prodcycle/compliance-code-scanner@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.PRODCYCLE_API_KEY }}
    include: "**/*.tf,**/*.yaml,**/*.yml,**/Dockerfile"
    exclude: "test/**,docs/**"
```

### Use outputs in subsequent steps

```yaml
- uses: prodcycle/compliance-code-scanner@v1
  id: compliance
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.PRODCYCLE_API_KEY }}
  continue-on-error: true

- run: |
    echo "Passed: ${{ steps.compliance.outputs.passed }}"
    echo "Findings: ${{ steps.compliance.outputs.findings-count }}"
    echo "Scan: ${{ steps.compliance.outputs.scan-id }}"
```

### Explicit full codebase scan

If you want to force a comprehensive scan of the entire codebase regardless of the event trigger, you can explicitly set `scan-mode: full`:

```yaml
- uses: prodcycle/compliance-code-scanner@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.PRODCYCLE_API_KEY }}
    scan-mode: full
```

### Self-hosted ProdCycle instance

```yaml
- uses: prodcycle/compliance-code-scanner@v1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.PRODCYCLE_API_KEY }}
    api-url: https://api.yourcompany.com
```

## Supported frameworks

| ID     | Framework                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `soc2` | SOC 2                                  |
| `hipaa`| HIPAA                                  |
| `nist` | NIST 800-53 / Cybersecurity Framework  |

If no `frameworks` input is specified, the action uses the frameworks configured on your ProdCycle workspace.

## Permissions

The action requires the following GitHub token permissions:

- `contents: read` to checkout and read changed files
- `pull-requests: write` to post annotations and summary comments

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run type-check    # TypeScript check
pnpm run test          # Run tests
